## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TechHog, a US-based, competent developer in highschool working with Lua(u) and C++ who occasionally does stuff in python3 and rust too.

My discord is techhog (402264559509045258), and I use the name TechHog/techhog everywhere.

I primary speak English, but I may be able to communicate in Spanish depending on the subject.

## Favorite projects of mine

* [Luau Beautifier](https://github.com/TechHog8984/luau_beautifier) - A fast Luau code formatter in C++ capable of solving a wide range of expressions
* [Droppher](https://github.com/TechHog8984/droppher) - A super WIP Hypixel overlay in rust with a current focus on the Dropper minigame.
* [luau_pack](https://github.com/TechHog8984/roblox_pack.luau) - A Luau (de)serialization library for Roblox
