## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TechHog, a US-based, competent developer in highschool working with Lua(u) and C++ who occasionally does stuff in Python3 and Rust too.

My discord is techhog (402264559509045258), and I use the name TechHog/techhog everywhere.

I primarily speak English, but I may be able to communicate in Spanish depending on the subject.

## Favorite projects of mine

* [Luau Beautifier](../../../luau_beautifier) - A fast Luau code formatter in C++ capable of simplifying a wide range of expressions
* [Droppher](../../../droppher) - An experimental and relatively feature-less Hypixel overlay in rust with a current focus on the Dropper minigame
* [roblox_pack](../../../roblox_pack.luau) - A Luau (de)serialization library for Roblox
* [inu](../../../inu) - A WIP tool in Rust for working with Lua bytecode
